# Description

Originally created by [chenxiccc](https://github.com/chenxiccc/obsidian-auto-download-images-after-web-clipping). This version uses Obsidian's native attachment download mechanism and doesn't contain translations.

When you use the [web clipper](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/obsidian-web-clipper/cnjifjpddelmedmihgijeibhnjfabmlf) plugin in Obsidian to save a webpage, the images on the webpage will not be saved locally and will still reference the online image URL addresses.
I want the images to be saved locally.
There are several solutions. For example, you can assign a shortcut key to `editor:download-attachments` to manually download the images to your local device.
However, I hope for something more automated. So this plugin was created.

# Plugin Features

This plugin is very simple. When you clip a document using the Web Clipper plugin, it will automatically download the images in the document to your local device in the background.

# Configuration Options

## Folder Monitoring

By default, the plugin is set to monitor the "Clippings" folder (you can modify it or add more folders to monitor). When a new file is created in this folder, the plugin will automatically download the images inside the file to your local device.

## Image Save Path

You can adjust the save path of images in the settings:
Follow Obsidian's attachment save location (default)
Create a folder with the same name as the file
A specified subfolder in the directory where the file is located

# How to Install

## Method 1:

You can download the compressed file from Releases, extract it to the `.obsidian/plugins` directory in Obsidian, then refresh the plugin list in Obsidian and enable it.

## Method 2

Use the BRAT plugin, click the BRAT button in the sidebar, click Add Plugin, and enter: [https://github.com/chenxiccc/obsidian-auto-download-imgs-after-web-clipping](https://github.com/chenxiccc/obsidian-auto-download-imgs-after-web-clipping)
